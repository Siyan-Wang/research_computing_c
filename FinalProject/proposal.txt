My final project will focus on the hydrologic performance of bioswale/rain garden (a type of green infrastructure) in bronx. I have been working on research about the water retention ability of bioswale/rain garden for a while and several data has been collected and available on a bioswale located in Bronx: the soil moisture data at different depths below the ground from Aug.2016 till now recorded every 15 minutes, which provides the soil moisture profile of the bioswale. The field measurements on inflow and outflow of a bioswale done by me and our group members during 2 rainfall events with time-scale of second (i.e. using different gauging methods for the small watershed of the bioswale). We also have a long-term rain gague on the site with data recorded every 15 minutes. I plan to use Python to analyze all of the aforementioned data and try to develop a infiltration model (Maybe via MATLAB) to predict the hydrologic performance of the bioswale given the precipitation data. The visualize part will include the soil moisture profile and data analysis on different variables and quantities. Unlike our homework, this project will focus on data at small scale (one site) and emphasis more on time series analysis and engineering aspect (I am an engineering student).
