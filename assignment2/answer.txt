#1 How many earthquakes are listed in the table?
#The answer should equal to the total lines of the file minus 1. Based on observations, each line is a individual record for an individual event
#unix command
wc -l signif.txt.tsv
#answer produced: 5959 signif.txt.tsv
#the final answer should be 5958 for the total number of earthquakes


#2 How many columns are in the table?
#unix command:
head -n 1 signif.txt.tsv | wc -w
#answer: 47

#3Use the cut command to create a new file that just has the data from the columns for YEAR, EQ_PRIMARY and COUNTRY. Hint: you can get the column numbers by using the head command to view the first row and then visuall$
#unix command:
cut -f 3,10,18  signif.txt.tsv > Year_Mag_Country.tsv
#answer:no standard output, but a file that contains three needed data columns has been created.

#4 EQ_PRIMARY is the assigned earthquake magnitude. With your new file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv', sort the data based on the numeric value of the EQ_PRIMARY column, then list the lines for the top ten largest earthquakes.
#unix command:
sort -k 2  Year_Mag_Country.tsv | tail -n 10
#answer:
2010	 8.8	CHILE
1716	 8.8	PERU
1812	 8.8	USA
1952	 9.0	RUSSIA
1700	 9.0	USA
2004	 9.1	INDONESIA
2011	 9.1	JAPAN
1964	 9.2	USA
1960	 9.5	CHILE
YEAR	EQ_PRIMARY	COUNTRY

#5 How many unique countries are listed in the database? Use cut,sort,uniq, wc and a few pipes | to form a single expression that answers this question.
#unix command:
cut -f 18 signif.txt.tsv | sort | uniq | wc -l
#the 18th column is the coountry column, sorted countries' name uniquely and then counted lines
#answer: 154

#6 Use the grep command to count how many earthquakes in the database are located in the USA or USA TERRITORY
#unix command:
grep -w USA Year_Mag_Country.tsv | wc -l
answer: 294

#7 Expanding on the previous exercise, refine your command sequence so that it only counts earthquakes in the USA and not ones in USA TERRITORY. Hint: use the -v argument with grep and you may need to call grep more th$
#unix command:
grep -w "USA" Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep -w -v "USA TERRITORY" | wc -l
# extract lines containes "USA" which would also contains "USA TERRITORY", so the next step
#of this pipeline is to exclude lines with "USA TERRITORY"
#answer: 255

#8 Compute the total number of earthquakes in each country and then display the top ten countries along with the number of earthquakes. Hint: this can be done with a command sequence similar to exercise 5, but requires$
#unix command:
cut -f 3  Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
#answer: 
 193 MEXICO
 207 PHILIPPINES
 255 USA
 259 GREECE
 319 TURKEY
 324 ITALY
 363 INDONESIA
 365 IRAN
 400 JAPAN
 579 CHINA

#9 Create a shell script named countEq.sh that returns the total number of earthquakes for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Hint: see the Shell Script notes and use$
#unix command:
nano countEQ.sh
#after initiate the shell script, write the script and run it using the next command
bash countEQ.sh USA
#answer: 294

#10 Create a shell script named countEq_getLargestEq.sh that returns both the total number of earthquakes AND the largest earthquake for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the sc$
#unix command:
nano countEq_getLargestEq.sh
#after initiate the shell script, write the script and run it using the next command
bash countEq_getLargestEq.sh CHILE
#answer:
country: CHILE
total number of earthquakes:
     192
largest earthquakes information:
1960	 9.5	CHILE



#11 Compute the total number of earthquakes each year and then output a sorted list of the top ten years with the most earthquakes. Paste your command and the top ten list below.
#unix command:
cut -f 1  Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
#the first column of the Year_Mag_Country.tsv consist of all the years listed, this command is similar to #8
#answer:
  59 2011
  60 2002
  60 2005
  60 2009
  61 2006
  62 2010
  67 2007
  72 2003
  77 2008
  78 2004
# first column as number of earthquakes, second column as the years with most frequent earthquakes 

#12 Create a shell script that loops over the top ten years with the most earthquakes (from exercise 11), finds all the earthquakes for a given year and writes them to file named $YEAR-earthquakes.txt, where $YEAR is t$
#see answer12.sh for the unix command
#answer: no standard output, please see the output file.
